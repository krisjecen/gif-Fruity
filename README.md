# gif-Fruity üçì
gif-Fruity connects you with fruit gifs using Giphy's API. Click the buttons to display fruity gifs, add your own fruits to the button list, and toggle gif animation by clicking the images. Check out [gif-Fruity!](https://krisjecen.github.io/gif-Fruity/)

Each gif button serves up 10 gifs related to the listed fruit, along with the gif ratings. We're not getting too wild with our gif-Fruity gifs, so you'll only find G- and PG-rated gifs here.
